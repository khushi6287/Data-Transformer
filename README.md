Data Transformer - Advanced SQL Project

📖 Project Overview

Data Transformer is a comprehensive SQL project designed to enhance practical knowledge of advanced SQL operations. This project demonstrates hands-on experience with Joins, Subqueries, Date and String Manipulation Functions, Window Functions, and SQL CASE Expressions. The project simulates a Corporate Data Analysis System with core functionalities for customer information management, sales transaction processing, and employee performance data analysis.

🗄️ Database Schema

The project uses three main tables:

Customers Table

· CustomerID (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
· FirstName (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
· LastName (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
· Email (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
· RegistrationDate (DATE, NOT NULL)

Orders Table

· OrderID (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
· CustomerID (INT, Foreign Key referencing Customers)
· OrderDate (DATE, NOT NULL)
· TotalAmount (DECIMAL(10,2), NOT NULL)

Employees Table

· EmployeeID (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
· FirstName (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
· LastName (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
· Department (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
· HireDate (DATE, NOT NULL)
· Salary (DECIMAL(10,2), NOT NULL)

🚀 Features Implemented

SQL Joins

· ✅ INNER JOIN: Retrieve all orders and customer details where orders exist
· ✅ LEFT JOIN: Retrieve all customers and their corresponding orders (if any)
· ✅ RIGHT JOIN: Retrieve all orders and their corresponding customers (if any)
· ✅ FULL OUTER JOIN: Retrieve all customers and all orders, regardless of matching

Subqueries

· ✅ Find customers who placed orders worth more than average amount
· ✅ Find employees with salaries above average salary

Date Functions

· ✅ Extract year and month from OrderDate
· ✅ Calculate difference in days between order date and current date
· ✅ Format OrderDate to readable format (DD-MMM-YYYY)

String Manipulation

· ✅ Concatenate FirstName and LastName to form full name
· ✅ Replace part of strings (John → Jonathan)
· ✅ Convert text cases (uppercase/lowercase)
· ✅ Trim extra spaces from fields

Window Functions

· ✅ Calculate running total of order amounts
· ✅ Rank orders based on TotalAmount using RANK()

CASE Expressions

· ✅ Assign dynamic discounts based on order amounts
· ✅ Categorize employee salaries (High/Medium/Low)
